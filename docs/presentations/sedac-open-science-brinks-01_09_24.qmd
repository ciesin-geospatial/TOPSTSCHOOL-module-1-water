## Presentation Outline

-   Module Goals
-   Learning objectives
-   Open Science Components
-   Technical details
-   Proposed analyses and outputs

## Lesson Goals

-   The objective of this lesson is to provide content for learning water resource issues through data exploration and analysis.
-   We are introducing 3 datasets for this module
    +   MODIS NRT Flood Data
    +   NYC Lead Data
    +   _WSIM-GLDAS_

## Open Science Components

Like all other components of the SCHOOL project, the water resource modules are entirely open source.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

- Open source computing (R, Rstudio, VS Code, QGIS, etc.)
- Open source datasets; freely available and well documented
- Open source development
- Open source "results" on GitHub Pages
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](open_science_nasa.jpg)
:::
::::
::: {.notes}
- Development components are also open science. We're bringing along research assistants with descriptive vignette templates/lessons
- I'm developing on a mix of tech stacks, but it's important to make sure our modules work on Linux/Ubuntu
:::

## Narrative Objectives

We are currently in the early development phases and need to adjust the narrative voice between 3 learning/content components.

- Water resources 
- Technical data
- Technical coding

::: {.notes}
One goal of these two days is to solicit feedback regarding objectives like these. 
:::

## Water Resource Narrative

These include introducing the domain knowledge and human narrative that can be derived from these datasets.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Understanding the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of droughts and floods.
- Exploring drought and flooding events in areas of interest to you and learning about the impacts to local water supplies, agriculture, recreation, and tourism. 
- Basic background on the water cycle.
:::

## Technical Data Narrative

- What does water resource data "look" like?
- Where do you find it and *how* do you get it?

![](cube2.png){fig-align='center'}

::: {.notes}
- Here we have a complex structure with data cubes/netcdf, but other lessons in the module and other modules will feature a variety of data structures
:::

## Coding Narrative

Are we interested at all in teaching people how to code? Unlikely but then how do you address all the code.

```{.r}
# generate a vector of dates for subsetting
keeps<-seq(lubridate::ymd("2000-01-01"),
           lubridate::ymd("2014-12-01"), 
           by = "month")
           
# filter using that vector
wsim_gldas_anoms <- dplyr::filter(wsim_gldas_anoms, time %in% keeps)

# verify the time dimension was properly subsetted
print(wsim_gldas_anoms)

# do a visual check with the first 6 time-steps
wsim_gldas_anoms |>
  dplyr::slice(index = 1:6, along = "time") |>
  plot(key.pos = 1)
```

## WSIM-GLDAS

WSIM-GLDAS is an open source dataset that characterizes surpluses and deficits of freshwater and the parameters determining these anomalies.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}
- Globally rasterized dataset issued monthly for 1948-2014
- Composite surplus/deficit anomalies
- Multitude of additional metrics and integration periods
- [Freely available on SEDAC](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/water-wsim-gldas-v1)
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}

::::

::: {.notes}
The datasets are available as multidimensional netCDF files
:::

## Outputs and Analyses

Whatever the chosen narrative voice and content, we hope to bring greater understanding for each module through visualizations and analysis. The WSIM-GLDAS water resource modules will achieve this by creating:

- National and regional 12 month integration composite surplus/deficit maps
- Time series illustrations of point locations
- Population exposure time series figures and tables

## Composite Surplus and Deficit Maps

Twelve month integration maps illustrate the observed drought or flooding of an area relative to a long term baseline period.

![](United_States_Composite_Adjusted_200001-201412_12mo_panel.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}

::: {.notes}
- Longer term integration plots quickly summarize climate trends for large areas, and help users identify areas of interest. 
:::

## Composite Surplus and Deficit Maps (cont.)

Now you can zoom in on an area of interest with a monthly time series.

## Location of Interest

Point location time series figures illustrate long term trends for a single location on a month to month basis. 

![](Houston_TX_201412_gldas_PETmE_1mo_201001_loi.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}

::: {.notes}
- These plots can really bring the impacts of droughts and floods to a specific point; your home, your school, etc.
:::

## Population Exposure 

Population exposure plots and tables help illustrate the sociological impacts of droughts and floods.

![](United_States_of_America_Texas_201312_1mo_int__pop_exposure.png){fig-align='center' width=70%}

::: {.notes}
- Commonplace to show maps depicting extreme heat or floods in a particular area, but does anyone actually live there?
:::

## Current Drafts

Although the module and lesson structure is yet to be finalized, we have some rough drafts in place that demonstrate the baseline technical workflow and present a template for dev assistants.

## An Open Process

This is an open process reliant on feedback from our:

- Subject matter experts
- Project managers 
- Development team
- Research assistants
- Users and collaborators like _you_

We always welcome comments, contributors, and all types of feedback in person, through the TOPS network, and our GitHub repositories.
